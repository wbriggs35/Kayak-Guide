Paddle Point is an electrical device that uses a GPS to locate the lead paddlers latitude and longitude coordinates, which are transmitted and turned into position vectors relative to the visually impaired paddlers location. The device uses vibrational motors to create haptic feedback and transmit the appropriate vibration intensity to the user.
